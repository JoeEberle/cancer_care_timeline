## Solution Overview: 

**Survival time analysis**, also known as survival analysis or time-to-event analysis, is a statistical method used to analyze the time until an event of interest occurs, such as death, disease recurrence, or treatment failure. In healthcare, survival time analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the prognosis of patients, evaluating the effectiveness of treatments, and identifying factors that influence patient outcomes. By accounting for censored data and modeling time-dependent variables, survival time analysis provides insights into the natural history of diseases, aiding clinicians in making informed decisions about patient care and treatment strategies.
