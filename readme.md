## Solution Overview: 

**Survival time analysis**, also known as survival analysis or time-to-event analysis, is a statistical method used to analyze the time until an event of interest occurs, such as death, disease recurrence, or treatment failure. In healthcare, survival time analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the prognosis of patients, evaluating the effectiveness of treatments, and identifying factors that influence patient outcomes. By accounting for censored data and modeling time-dependent variables, survival time analysis provides insights into the natural history of diseases, aiding clinicians in making informed decisions about patient care and treatment strategies.

## De Novo - From the beginning

The Latin term **"de novo"** means **"from the beginning"** or "anew." In the context of epidemiology, "de novo" is often used to describe the emergence of a disease or condition that appears for the first time in a population, without any prior occurrence or known precursor. It implies that the condition has developed anew rather than from an existing condition or source.

For example, a "de novo" mutation refers to a new genetic mutation that arises spontaneously rather than being inherited from a parent. Similarly, a "de novo" case of a disease might refer to the first occurrence of that disease in a specific population or individual, indicating it is not a recurrence or continuation of a previous outbreak or condition.


 ## Cancer Treatment Timelines 
 1. **T1** - De novo Cancer Diagnosis 
  2. **T2** - Time from T1 to Pathology 
  3. **T3** - Time from T1 to Biopsy 
  4. **T4** - Time from T1 to Cancer Screening 
  5. **T5** - Time from T1 to Genomic Assay 
  6. **T6** - Time from T1 to Oncology Referral 
  7. **T7** - Time from T1 to Care Plan 
  8. **T8** - Time from T1 to First Line Modality Treatment 
  9. **T9** - Time from T1 to First Therapeutic Response 
  10. **T10** - Time from T1 to Second Modality Treatment 
  11. **T11** - Time from T1 to First Therapeutic Switch 
  12. **T12** - Time from T1 to Remission 
  13. **T13** - Time from T1 to Cure 
  14. **T14** - Time from T1 to Death 
  15. **T15** - Time from T1 to Palliation / Hospice 
  16. **T16** - Time from T1 to Active Surveillance / Maintenance 
  17. **T17** - Time from T1 to Neo - Adjuvant Treatment 
  18. **T18** - Time from T1 to Adjuvant Treatment 
  19. **T19** - Time from T1 to Inpatient Hospitalization 
  20. **T20** - Time from T1 to ED / Urgent Care Event
