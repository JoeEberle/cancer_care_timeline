## Solution Overview: 

**Survival time analysis**, also known as survival analysis or time-to-event analysis, is a statistical method used to analyze the time until an event of interest occurs, such as death, disease recurrence, or treatment failure. In healthcare, survival time analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the prognosis of patients, evaluating the effectiveness of treatments, and identifying factors that influence patient outcomes. By accounting for censored data and modeling time-dependent variables, survival time analysis provides insights into the natural history of diseases, aiding clinicians in making informed decisions about patient care and treatment strategies.

## De Novo - From the beginning

The Latin term **"de novo"** means **"from the beginning"** or "anew." In the context of epidemiology, "de novo" is often used to describe the emergence of a disease or condition that appears for the first time in a population, without any prior occurrence or known precursor. It implies that the condition has developed anew rather than from an existing condition or source.

For example, a "de novo" mutation refers to a new genetic mutation that arises spontaneously rather than being inherited from a parent. Similarly, a "de novo" case of a disease might refer to the first occurrence of that disease in a specific population or individual, indicating it is not a recurrence or continuation of a previous outbreak or condition.
